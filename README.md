# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋  

I'm a Frontend Developer focused on creating fast, accessible, and scalable web applications using React, Next.js (13/14), TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy working with modern web architecture, component-driven design, and performance optimization (Core Web Vitals such as LCP and CLS).

My work is centered around:
- Clean and maintainable code
- UI consistency and accessibility
- Performance-oriented development
- SSG/ISR rendering strategies
- Modern Next.js patterns (App Router, Server Components)

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, MySQL  
- **Other:** Git, SCRUM, CI/CD (basic), Accessibility (a11y), Performance optimization

### 🧪 Experiments & Learning
Outside my daily workflow, I explore:
- Unity (C#) small prototypes and mechanics
- Algorithm and data structure practice  
- Backend architecture experiments  
- Performance testing & rendering behavior insights

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Advanced Next.js features  
- Scalable frontend architecture  
- Web performance techniques
